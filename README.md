# Python-programming

### Hey there!

### I put all my recent Python codes here.

### 1) In the "Algorithm-study" folder, you can find my codes for algorithm and data structure questions from Leetcode.

### 2) The "Ascending model" is a google jupyter notebook on the ascending model of the High ALtitude Balloon.

# This time I created a new branch from local repo and want to know what will hapen for the remote repo
