# Python-programming

### Hey there!

### I put all my recent Python codes here.

### 1) In the "Algorithm-study" folder, you can find my codes for algorithm and data structure questions from Leetcode.

### 2) The "Ascending model" is a google jupyter notebook on the ascending model of the High ALtitude Balloon.
